Credit card fraud refers to a scammer using your credit card number and PIN or your stolen credit card for financial transactions from your account and without your knowledge.

By Identifying that the transaction is done by scammer, we can block the card so that no can take money out of the account

For this we need to create a Machine learning model to predict whether the transaction which is happening is done by a fraud or a legit card user
